# async_deep_reinforce

A3C implementation which trains an agent for a small MDP.

Simplified version of https://github.com/miyosuda/async_deep_reinforce, useful as a starting point for applications of A3C other than Atari games.

The MDP is from https://github.com/spragunr/deep_q_rl/blob/master/deep_q_rl/test/test_q_network.py.
